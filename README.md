### First, the biblicals:

shell script to download all volumes of Lord Knuth's Art of Computer Programming: (you can copy from the next line at once, since all the styled texts will recognized as comments in the shell)

## And the following...
are books and resources loved by r/learnprogramming community for going the extra mile of curiosity in the CS world. Compiled by me, a lurker who kept track.

Websites and online resources:

[amazing detailed notes for math foundations of computing](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~luca/cs103-14/index.html#notes)

[detailed walk-through of general compilation and interpretation techniques by actually building two interpreters in Java and C](https://craftinginterpreters.com/)

[web tool to help you type code and see it translate to assembly](https://godbolt.org/)

[Computer Science Crash Course by Raspberry Pi Foundation](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL8dPuuaLjXtNlUrzyH5r6jN9ulIgZBpdo)

[what every programmer should know about floating-pointer arithmetic, and more](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19957-01/806-3568/ncg_goldberg.html)

[follow-up of last link - what every programmer should know about memory](https://people.freebsd.org/~lstewart/articles/cpumemory.pdf)

[series by Ben Eater where he builds an entire computer on a breadboard and explains everything well](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLowKtXNTBypGqImE405J2565dvjafglHU)

[this](https://www.nand2tetris.org/) along with [this](http://nandgame.com/) explains everything from the logic gate on up to a functioning system

[this teaches you to build a modern computer from first principles.](https://www.coursera.org/learn/build-a-computer)

http://home.netcom.com/~tjensen/ptr/pointers.htm [introduces pointers to beginning programmers in the C programming language]

 [And this.](https://skilldrick.github.io/easy6502/) 6502 is what old consoles ran on. After you assemble you can click the disassemble or hexdump button to see the difference between `lda #$01` and `lda $01`!
